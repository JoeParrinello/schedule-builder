		<h3>NJIT Course Schedule Builder For Students
		<br/>Who Can't Read Good
		and Want To Learn To Do Other Stuff Good Too</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="bdy">
		Changes:
<ul>
	<li>Apr/May, 2011 - fixed a bug in the schedule generator that was causing it to return
	too many results. A list that produced 135,819 possible combinations now yields 54,191;
	also improving the memory consumption (which is horrible).</li>
	<li>Apr/May, 2011 - fixed problems with SQL index. courses should load faster (does not
	affect autocomplete).</li>
	<li>Apr/May, 2011 - added a simple graph that takes the set of input courses and
	generates a graph visualizing the structure being used to find valid combinations.</li>
	<li>Apr/May, 2011 - switched over to use localStorage</li>
	<li>Apr, 2011 - added better support for printing -- uses SVG/VML so the printing should
	be fairly consistent across all browsers.</li>
</ul>
